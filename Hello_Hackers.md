#Hello Hackers

##1. Intro to Commands

###Challenge

The challenge was to obtain the flag by invoking the hello command.

###Thought Process

To complete this challenge, I needed to invoke the `hello` command. This command would give me the flag required for the completion of the challenge. It's important to keep in mind that Linux commands are **case-sensitive**, so typing "hello" is different from typing "HELLO."

###Solution

I typed in the following command:
`hello`
Once I typed it in and hit Enter, I received the flag.

##2. Intro to Arguments

###Challenge

The challenge was to obtain the flag by invoking the hello command with a single argument of hackers.

###Thought Process

The task required me to run the hello command with a single argument hackers. I recalled that arguments are additional datas passed to the command and its syntax is command followed by an argument.

###Solution

I typed in the following command:
`hello hackers`
Once I typed it in and hit Enter, I received the flag.
