# Beyond A Display

## Challenge Description

I took a metro from this location and I saw a shopping complex in the vicinity. I remembered that I saw a multidimensional billboard from a company over there. The same company held a concert on 26th October 2024, and a group performed there. However, I have forgotten what the information really was. Can you help me?

## Solution

This was the attached image file

I searched this in Google Images and most of the results were pointing towards Belvedere Towers Metro Station. I confirmed it using Google Maps and it was indeed Belvedere

Then I searched for "multidimensional billboards in Gurugram" and many of the results were showing the below Hyundai's 3D Billboard Ad

Assuming Hyundai was the company that held the concert, I went through the concerts that were held by Hyundai in this [site](https://hyundaispotlight.in/) which gave me the following result
