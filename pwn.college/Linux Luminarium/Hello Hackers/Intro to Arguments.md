### Challenge

The challenge was to obtain the flag by invoking the hello command with a single argument of hackers.

### Thought Process

The task required me to run the hello command with a single argument hackers. I recalled that arguments are additional datas passed to the command and its syntax is command followed by an argument.

### Solution

I typed in the following command:
`hello hackers`
Once I typed it in and hit Enter, I received the flag.
