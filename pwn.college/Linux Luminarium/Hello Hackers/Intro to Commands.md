### Challenge

The challenge was to obtain the flag by invoking the hello command.

### Thought Process

To complete this challenge, I needed to invoke the `hello` command. This command would give me the flag required for the completion of the challenge. It's important to keep in mind that Linux commands are **case-sensitive**, so typing "hello" is different from typing "HELLO."

### Solution

I typed in the following command:
`hello`
Once I typed it in and hit Enter, I received the flag.
