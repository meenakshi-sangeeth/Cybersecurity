### Challenge

To collect the flag by creating two files `/tmp/pwn` and `/tmp/college`, and running `/challenge/run`

I knew that `touch` command will create files

### Solution

I used the following commands
```bash
touch /tmp/pwn
touch /tmp/college
/challenge/run
```
Upon execution, I got the flag
