### Challenge

To collect the flag by invoking pwn program using its absolute path.

### Thought Process

The challenge required required running pwn program using its **absolute path**. In Linux, an absolute path starts from the root directory (`/`) and specifies the complete location of a file or program.

```bash
/pwn
```
Upon execution, I received the flag.
