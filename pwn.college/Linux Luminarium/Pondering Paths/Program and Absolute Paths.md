### Challenge

To collect the flag by invoking the file named `run` within the `/challenge` directory.

### Thought Process

I understood that the challenge program `run` was located in the `/challenge` directory, and I needed to execute it by invoking its **absolute path**. 
Thus I used the following command
```bash
/challenge/run
```
Upon execution, I got the flag.
