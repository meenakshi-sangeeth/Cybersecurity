### Challenge

To collect the flag by invoking `/challenge/challenge` program with the argument `--giveflag`

### Thought Process

The task required me to run`/challenge/challenge` with athe argument `--giveflag`. I recalled that arguments are additional datas passed to the command and its syntax is command followed by an argument.

### Solution

I used the following command
```bash
/challenge/challenge --giveflag
```
Upon execution, I got the flag
