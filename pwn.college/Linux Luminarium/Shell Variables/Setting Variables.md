### Challenge

To collect the flag by setting the PWN variable to the value COLLEGE 

### Thought Process

I knew that variables can be set to a value using `=`. I had to make sure that there are no spaces around the `=` because if there are spaces, the shell won't recognize a variable assignment

### Solution

I used the following command
```bash
PWN=COLLEGE
```
Upon execution, I got the flag
