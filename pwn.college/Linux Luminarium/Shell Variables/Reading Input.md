### Challenge

To collect the flag by setting the PWN variable to the value COLLEGE using `read`

### Thought Process

I knew that `read` is used when you have to set a variable to a value inputted by the user. It can be done by executing `read` followed by the variable name

### Solution

I used the following command
```bash
read PWN
```
After execution, I entered COLLEGE into the terminal which gave me the flag
