### Challenge

To collect the flag by launching `/challenge/run` backgrounded

### Thought Process

I knew that a process can be backgrounded without suspending it by appending `&` to the command

### Solution

I executed the following command
```bash
/challenge/run &
```
Upon execution, I got the flag
