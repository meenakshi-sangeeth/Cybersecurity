### Challenge

To collect the flag by interrupting `/challenge/run`

### Thought Process

I knew that a process can be interrupted by holding down the Ctrl key and pressing C

### Solution

I executed the following command
```bash
/challenge/run
```
I got the following output
```bash
I could give you the flag... but I won't, until this process exits. Remember, 
you can force me to exit with Ctrl-C. Try it now!
```
Thus I entered Ctrl-C which gave me the flag
