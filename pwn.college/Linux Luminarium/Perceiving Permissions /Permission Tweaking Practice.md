### Challenge

To collect the flag by changing the permissions of the `/challenge/pwn` file correctly eight times in a row

### Thought Process

I will have to launch `/challenge/run` to get started and then use `chmod` accordingly to the output

### Solution

I used the following commands
```bash
/challenge/run
```
Upon execution, I got the following output
```bash
Round 0 (of 8)!

Current permissions of "/challenge/pwn": rw-r--r--
* the user does have read permissions
* the user does have write permissions
- the user doesn't have execute permissions
* the group does have read permissions
- the group doesn't have write permissions
- the group doesn't have execute permissions
* the world does have read permissions
- the world doesn't have write permissions
- the world doesn't have execute permissions

Needed permissions of "/challenge/pwn": rw----r--
* the user does have read permissions
* the user does have write permissions
- the user doesn't have execute permissions
- the group doesn't have read permissions
- the group doesn't have write permissions
- the group doesn't have execute permissions
* the world does have read permissions
- the world doesn't have write permissions
- the world doesn't have execute permissions
```
`chmod` was used repeatedly to change the permissions in the following manner
```bash
hacker@permissions~permission-tweaking-practice:~$ /challenge/run

You've solved all 8 rounds! I have changed the ownership
of the /flag file so that you can 'chmod' it. You won't be able to read
it until you make it readable with chmod!

Current permissions of "/flag": ---------
- the user doesn't have read permissions
- the user doesn't have write permissions
- the user doesn't have execute permissions
- the group doesn't have read permissions
- the group doesn't have write permissions
- the group doesn't have execute permissions
- the world doesn't have read permissions
- the world doesn't have write permissions
- the world doesn't have execute permissions
hacker@permissions~permission-tweaking-practice:~$ chmod u+r /flag
