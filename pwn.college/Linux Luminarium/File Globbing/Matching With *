### Challenge

To collect the flag by running `/challenge/run` after changing your directory to `/challenge`, using `*` glob to keep the argument you pass to `cd` to at most four characters

### Thought Process

I knew that when `*` character is encountered in any argument, the shell will treat it as "wildcard" and try to replace that argument with any files that match the pattern. Thus if make use of `*`, I can limit the characters of argument to at most four

### Solution

I used the following command
```bash
cd /ch*
```
Upon execution, the directory was changed to `/challenge`. After that I used the following command
```bash
/challenge/run
```
Upon execution, I got the flag
