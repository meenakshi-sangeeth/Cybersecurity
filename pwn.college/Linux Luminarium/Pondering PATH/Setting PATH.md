### Challenge

To collect the flag by overwriting `PATH` with `/challenge/more_commands/` directory

### Thought Process

I knew that `PATH` can be set to a new value or overwrite it using `=` since `PATH` is a variable

### Solution

I used the following commands
```bash
PATH=/challenge/more_commands/
/challenge/run
```
Upon execution, I recieved the flag
