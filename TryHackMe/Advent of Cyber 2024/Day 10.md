# Key Concepts

- Phishing Attacks
  Phishing tricks people into revealing personal information or installing harmful software. Imagine someone sends a fake email pretending to be from your bank, asking you to click a link or open a file to "fix" a problem. The goal is to steal your information or take control of your device.
- Macros
  A macro is like a set of instructions that tells the computer what to do automatically, saving you time on repetitive tasks.Imagine you're writing hundreds of checks and need to convert numbers to words for each one. Instead of typing it manually every time, you can create a macroâ€”a tiny program inside a Word document to automate this task.Hackers can hide harmful programs inside these macros. If you open a document with a dangerous macro, it could infect your system or give the attacker control.
