# Key Concepts

Imagine a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a digital security guard for an organization. It keeps an eye on everything happening in the network by collecting data (called events) from computers, servers, and other devices. All these events are sent to a central system called the SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) which acts like a "control room" where all the information is stored and monitored.
SOC uses rules to spot suspicious or harmful activities. If something matches these rules, an alert is triggered. Then, a SOC analyst (like a digital detective) investigates the alert to figure out if it's:
- True Positive (TP): Real malicious activity by an attacker.
- False Positive (FP): A harmless action that accidentally triggered the alert.
