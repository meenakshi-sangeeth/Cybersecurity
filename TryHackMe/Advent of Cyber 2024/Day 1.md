# Key Concepts

- Operational Security (OPSEC) is about protecting important information and activities from being discovered by enemies or attackers. When hackers or bad actors don’t follow OPSEC properly, they can leave behind clues that help investigators figure out who they are.
  Here’s how that can happen:
  - Reusing Names: If they use the same usernames or emails across different websites, it's easier to connect those accounts to them.
  - Hidden Information in Files: Sometimes files like pictures or code contain hidden details (like where they were made or when they were created) that can reveal personal information.
  - Posting in Public: Sharing details on forums or sites like GitHub can accidentally expose who they are or where they’re from.
  - Not Hiding Their Location: If they don’t use tools like a VPN to hide their real location, their internet address (IP address) can be tracked.

- A .lnk file is a Windows shortcut file used to point to another file, folder, or application on the computer. Hackers sometimes disguise malicious scripts as .lnk files. Clicking on such a shortcut can run harmful commands without the user's knowledge
