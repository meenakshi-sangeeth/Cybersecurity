# C3

## Challenge Description

This is the Custom Cyclical Cipher!
Download the ciphertext here.
Download the encoder here.
Enclose the flag in our wrapper for submission. If the flag was "example" you would submit "picoCTF{example}"

## Hint

Modern crypto schemes don't depend on the encoder to be secret, but this one does.


## Thought Process

Given below is the attached ciphertext followed by the encoder
```bash
DLSeGAGDgBNJDQJDCFSFnRBIDjgHoDFCFtHDgJpiHtGDmMAQFnRBJKkBAsTMrsPSDDnEFCFtIbEDtDCIbFCFtHTJDKerFldbFObFCFtLBFkBAAAPFnRBJGEkerFlcPgKkImHnIlATJDKbTbFOkdNnsgbnJRMFnRBNAFkBAAAbrcbTKAkOgFpOgFpOpkBAAAAAAAiClFGIPFnRBaKliCgClFGtIBAAAAAAAOgGEkImHnIl
```
```bash
import sys
chars = ""
from fileinput import input
for line in input():
  chars += line

lookup1 = "\n \"#()*+/1:=[]abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
lookup2 = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTabcdefghijklmnopqrst"

out = ""

prev = 0
for char in chars:
  cur = lookup1.index(char)
  out += lookup2[(cur - prev) % 40]
  prev = cur

sys.stdout.write(out)
```
The cipher is a combination of two lookup tables `lookup1` which maps characters to a set of symbols and `lookup2` which is a mapping of the alphabet (both uppercase and lowercase) to themselves. The code also involves modular arithmetic which applies a shift based on the difference between the current and previous character index. 

## Solution

We need to modify the script to decode the text and for that I used the following code

```bash
import sys

lookup1 = "\n \"#()*+/1:=[]abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
lookup2 = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTabcdefghijklmnopqrst"

ciphertext = "DLSeGAGDgBNJDQJDCFSFnRBIDjgHoDFCFtHDgJpiHtGDmMAQFnRBJKkBAsTMrsPSDDnEFCFtIbEDtDCIbFCFtHTJDKerFldbFObFCFtLBFkBAAAPFnRBJGEkerFlcPgKkImHnIlATJDKbTbFOkdNnsgbnJRMFnRBNAFkBAAAbrcbTKAkOgFpOgFpOpkBAAAAAAAiClFGIPFnRBaKliCgClFGtIBAAAAAAAOgGEkImHnIl"

decoded_text = ""

prev = 0

# Decode the ciphertext
for char in ciphertext:
    cur = lookup2.index(char)
    original_index = (cur + prev) % 40  # Reverse the modular subtraction
    decoded_text += lookup1[original_index]
    prev = original_index

# Output the decoded plaintext
sys.stdout.write(decoded_text)
```

On running it, I got another code

```
#asciiorder
#fortychars
#selfinput
#pythontwo

chars = ""
from fileinput import input
for line in input():
    chars += line
b = 1 / 1

for i in range(len(chars)):
    if i == b * b * b:
        print chars[i] #prints
        b += 1 / 1
```

I combined this with the previous code 
```bash
import sys

# Decrypted message
ciphertext = "DLSeGAGDgBNJDQJDCFSFnRBIDjgHoDFCFtHDgJpiHtGDmMAQFnRBJKkBAsTMrsPSDDnEFCFtIbEDtDCIbFCFtHTJDKerFldbFObFCFtLBFkBAAAPFnRBJGEkerFlcPgKkImHnIlATJDKbTbFOkdNnsgbnJRMFnRBNAFkBAAAbrcbTKAkOgFpOgFpOpkBAAAAAAAiClFGIPFnRBaKliCgClFGtIBAAAAAAAOgGEkImHnIl"

lookup1 = "\n \"#()*+/1:=[]abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
lookup2 = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTabcdefghijklmnopqrst"

plaintext = ""

for char in ciphertext:
    cur = lookup2.index(char)
    prev = lookup1.index(plaintext[-1]) if plaintext else 0
    plaintext += lookup1[(cur + prev) % 40]

chars = plaintext
b = 1

message = ''
for i in range(len(chars)):
    if i == b * b * b:
        print(chars[i])
        b += 1 / 1
        message += chars[i]

print("picoCTF{"+message+"}")
```

I got the following output

Thus the flag for this challenge is picoCTF{adlibs}
