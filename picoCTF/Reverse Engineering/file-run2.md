# file-run2

## Challenge Description

Another program, but this time, it seems to want some input. What happens if you try to run it on the command line with input "Hello!"?
Download the program here.

## Hint

Try running it and add the phrase "Hello!" with a space in front (i.e. "./run Hello!")

## Solution

As the hints suggested, I tried running the program by making it executable first and then appending the phrase `Hello!` to the pathfile, after making sure I was in the same directory as the downloaded program file

```bash
# chmod +x run
# ./run Hello!
The flag is: picoCTF{F1r57_4rgum3n7_f65ed63e}
```

Thus the flag for this challenge is `picoCTF{F1r57_4rgum3n7_f65ed63e}`
