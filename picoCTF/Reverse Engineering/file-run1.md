# file-run1

## Challenge Description

A program has been provided to you, what happens if you try to run it on the command line?
Download the program here.

## Hints

1. To run the program at all, you must make it executable (i.e. $ chmod +x run)
2. Try running it by adding a '.' in front of the path to the file (i.e. $ ./run)

## Solution

As the hints suggested, I tried running the program by making it executable first and then prepending a `.` in front of pathfile, after making sure I was in the same directory as the downloaded program file

```bash
# chmod +x run
# ./run
The flag is: picoCTF{U51N6_Y0Ur_F1r57_F113_e5559d46}
```

Thus the flag for this challenge is `picoCTF{U51N6_Y0Ur_F1r57_F113_e5559d46}`
