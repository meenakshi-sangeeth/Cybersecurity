Check this out.

## Solution

Guided by the name of the challenge I researched about `robots.txt`. It is a file used by website administrators to provide guidelines to web crawlers (like search engines) about which parts of the website should not be accessed or indexed. This file is located at the root of a website and can be accessed via `https://example.com/robots.txt`. By inspecting robots.txt, an attacker can gain clues about a websiteâ€™s structure or uncover hidden resources.
