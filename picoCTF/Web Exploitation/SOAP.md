## Hint

XML external entity Injection

## Solution

From the hint it is clear that we'll have to make use of XML external entity Injection. For that I referred [this](https://portswigger.net/web-security/xxe). In a nutshell, XML Injection is a type of web exploitation attack where malicious XML code is injected into an application's input to manipulate its behavior, extract data, or bypass security mechanisms. When an application processes user-supplied data within an XML structure without proper sanitization or validation, an attacker can inject malicious XML content. This can exploit vulnerabilities in how the application handles XML
I also made use of Burp Suite which is a comprehensive toolkit widely used for web application security testing. It acts as a proxy server between your browser and the target web application.
