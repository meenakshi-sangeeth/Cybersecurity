# IntroToBurp

## Challenge Description

Try here to find the flag 

## Hints

1. Try using burpsuite to intercept request to capture the flag. 
2. Try mangling the request, maybe their server-side code doesn't handle malformed requests very well. 

## Solution

I opened the provided URL which led to a registration page asking for basic info like name and email.

After filling out the details with random values and clicking "Register", the site redirected me to an OTP verification page.
I tried entering a random value like 123 and clicked submit. As expected, it showed "Invalid OTP".

I repeated the process a couple of times with other values and always got the same result

Since the challenge title is IntroToBurp and from the hints, I knew Burp Suite would be the key here. I intercepted the OTP submission request using Burp Suiteâ€™s Proxy.

```bash

Connection: keep-alive

otp=123
```
I began experimenting by changing the value of the OTP field. I tried SQLi payloads, scripts, and leaving it blank but all returned the same "Invalid OTP" message. 

Then I was like what if I completely removed the otp= parameter from the body?
So I edited the request in Burp Repeater to this:
```bash
makefile
CopyEdit
POST /verify
Host: ...
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 0
```
And... it worked!

Thus the flag for this challenge is `picoCTF{#0TP_Bypvss_SuCc3$S_9090d63c}`
