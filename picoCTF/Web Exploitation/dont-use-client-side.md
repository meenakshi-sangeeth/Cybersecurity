## Challenge Decsription

Can you break into this super secure portal? https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/29835/ (link) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:29835

## Hint

Never trust the client

## Solution

I found this upon inspecting the source code

We can see that in the `function verify()`, the password is being split into substrings or pieces of 4 characters each. Then the code checks the password piece by piece, but not in order. So the password can easily be reconstructed by ordering the pieces correctly

```bash
piece1: pico
piece2: CTF{
piece3: no_c
piece4: lien
piece5: ts_p
piece6: lz_7
piece7: 723c
piece8: e}
```

Thus the flag for this challenge is `picoCTF{no_clients_plz_7723ce}`
