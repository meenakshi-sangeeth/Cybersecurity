## Challenge Description

ABC Bank's website has a loan calculator to help its clients calculate the amount they pay if they take a loan from the bank. Unfortunately, they are using an eval function to calculate the loan. Bypassing this will give you Remote Code Execution (RCE). Can you exploit the bank's calculator and read the flag?
The website is running Here.

## Hinta

- Bypass regex
- The flag file is `/flag.txt`
- You might need encoding or dynamic construction to bypass restrictions.

## Solution

From the challenge description it is known that `eval()` function is being used to process user input. I started by inspecting the source code

It's clear that keywords like `os`,`eval`,`exec`,`bind`,`connect`,`python`,`socket`,`ls`,`cat`,`shell`,`bind` have been blocked. Also the `regex` filter blocks hex encoding, unicode encoding, URL encoding, file extensions and path traversal characters. So in order to open `/flag.txt`, I needed to construct the filename dynamically using ASCII values as mentioned in the hint

```bash
open(''.join([chr(x) for x in [47, 102, 108, 97, 103, 46, 116, 120, 116]])).read()
```

Thus the flag for this challenge is `picoCTF{D0nt_Use_Unsecure_f@nctions5e20166b}`
