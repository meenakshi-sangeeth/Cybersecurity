# Secrets

## Challenge Description

We have several pages hidden. Can you find the one with the flag?
The website is running here.

## Hint

folders folders folders

## Solution

Guided by the hint, I researched about web directories and I learnt the following.
A web server is a collection of folders where each folder (directory) can contain other folders and files. When we visit a website, we are essentially asking the server to open a folder and show us its contents.
To access these folders, we use the URL or the web address. It can be used with and without trailing slash. URL with trailing slash (`/xyz/`), the server will show the contents of a folder whereas URL without trailing slash (`/secret`), will show the server to find a file named `xyz`.

With this knowledge I tried to solve the challenge. I opened the website and viewed its page source

I found the folder `secret` and thus I added `/secret/` to the URL and viewed its page source

This led to another folder `hidden`. On continuing this process I found the flag

Thus the flag for this challenge is picoCTF{succ3ss_@h3n1c@10n_790d2615}




picoCTF{succ3ss_@h3n1c@10n_790d2615}
