## Hints

1. Filter your packets to narrow down your search. 
2. Attacks were done in timely manner. 
3. Time is essential 

## Solution

I opened the file in Wireshark and went through the packets to see if there's anything unusual. And I came across `==` in multiple packets which is a common signature for Base64-encoded data.

So I searched for all the packets which cointained `==` using `Ctrl+F` and decoded those strings using an [online converter](https://www.base64decode.org/)
