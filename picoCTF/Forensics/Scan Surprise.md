# Scan Surprise

## Challenge Description

I've gotten bored of handing out flags as text. Wouldn't it be cool if they were an image instead?
You can download the challenge files here:

## Hints

1. QR codes are a way of encoding data. While they're most known for storing URLs, they can store other things too.
2. Mobile phones have included native QR code scanners in their cameras since version 8 (Oreo) and iOS 11
3. If you don't have access to a phone, you can also use zbar-tools to convert an image to text

## Solution

Inside the attached zip folder was the following image

I simply scanned the QR code using an online [QR code scanner](https://scanqr.org/) and I got the flag

Thus the flag for this challenge is `picoCTF{p33k_@_b00_0194a007}`
