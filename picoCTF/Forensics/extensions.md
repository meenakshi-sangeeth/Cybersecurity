# extensions

## Challenge Description

This is a really weird text file TXT? Can you find the flag?

## Hint

How do operating systems know what kind of file it is? (It's not just the ending!

## Solution

I opened the attached text file

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7744b61e-0a8a-4d24-873a-fe4cbc450c6e)

The first few characters hinted that the file is a png file so I changed the extension to `png`.

Thus the flag for this challenge is `picoCTF{now_you_know_about_extensions}`
