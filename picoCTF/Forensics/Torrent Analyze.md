# Torrent Analyze

## Challenge Description

SOS, someone is torrenting on our network.
One of your colleagues has been using torrent to download some files on the companyâ€™s network. Can you identify the file(s) that were downloaded? The file name will be the flag, like picoCTF{filename}. Captured traffic

## Hints

- Download and open the file with a packet analyzer like Wireshark.
- You may want to enable BitTorrent protocol (BT-DHT, etc.) on Wireshark. Analyze -> Enabled Protocols
- Try to understand peers, leechers and seeds. Article
- The file name ends with .iso
  
## Solution

I opened the `torrent.pcap` file in Wireshark and first enabled the proper protocol for analysis. As the hint suggested, I made sure BT-DHT (Bittorrent DHT Protocol) is enabled, which allows Wireshark to properly decode and display the BitTorrent Distributed Hash Table protocol packets.

I [learned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg0RHkuTwlQ) that in BitTorrent protocols, each torrent is identified by an `info_hash`, a SHA-1 hash of the torrent file that uniquely identifies the content being shared.

I used Wireshark's search functionality to find packets containing `info_hash`. This showed many packets so I needed to filter further. Since we were looking for files downloaded by someone on our network, I focused on packets where the source address was from our local network `192.168.73.132` that contained `info_hash`.

```bah
bt-dht.bencoded.string contains info_hash and ip.src == 192.168.73.132
```

The filtered packets all contained the same `info_hash` value `e2467cbf021192c241367b892230dc1e05c0580e. This consistent hash across multiple packets indicated it was the main torrent our local host was downloading from. On googling, the hash corresponded to `ubuntu-19.10-desktop-amd64.iso`

Thus the flag for this challenge is `picoCTF{ubuntu-19.10-desktop-amd64.iso}`
