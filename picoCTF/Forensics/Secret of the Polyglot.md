Download the suspicious file here.

## Hints

This problem can be solved by just opening the file in different ways

## Solution

The file was a pdf when opened showed a string which seemed to be the last part of the flag. 

```bash
1n_pn9_&_pdf_53b741d6}
```

Guided by the hint, I changed the extension of the file from `pdf` to `png` and voil√† I got the first part of the flag

Thus, the flag for this challenge is `picoCTF{f1u3n7_1n_pn9_&_pdf_53b741d6}`
