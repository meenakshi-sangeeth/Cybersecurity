# Insp3ct0r

## Challenge Description

Kishor Balan tipped us off that the following code may need inspection: https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/44924/ (link) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:44924

## Hints

1. How do you inspect web code on a browser?
2. There's 3 parts

## Solution

As the hint suggested, and as is my first instinct for any web exploitation challenge, I inspected the source code. Under the Sources tab, I examined the html, css and javascript which gave me the flag. The flag was divided into three parts and hidden in the html, css and js codes respectively

Part 3

Thus the flag for this challenge is `picoCTF{tru3_d3t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t_lucky?f10be399}`
