I entered the suggested word "snickerdoodle" and I got this

Then I tried entering random words which gave me a different output

I figured cookies will have a role in this simply because the name of the challenge suggests so. Thus I inspected the cookies using the Google Developer Tools. I observed that the value of cookies when I enter "snickerdoodle" is 0 whereas when I enter random words, the value changes to -1

Then I started giving values from 0 to the cookies which gave me different outputs. For example when I entered 5, I got the following

After a lot of trial and error value 18 gave me the flag

## Incorrect Tangents

I could have implemented binary search to narrow down my search for the cookies value
