I scrolled and took a look at the whole thing. I just searched for "pico" using ` ctrl + f` to see if the flag was somewhere there in the page source but that was of no use. Then I opened the css scripts and searched for "pico" and the third css script gave me the flag

Thus the flag for this challenge is picoCTF{1nsp3ti0n_0f_w3bpag3s_587d12b8}
