Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.

## Hints

- This is an introduction of format string vulnerabilities. Look up "format specifiers" if you have never seen them before
- Just try out the different options

## Thought Process

The following code is the attached source

```bash
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <signal.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/types.h>

#define BUFSIZE 32
#define FLAGSIZE 64

char flag[FLAGSIZE];

void sigsegv_handler(int sig) {
    printf("\n%s\n", flag);
    fflush(stdout);
    exit(1);
}

int on_menu(char *burger, char *menu[], int count) {
    for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
        if (strcmp(burger, menu[i]) == 0)
            return 1;
    }
    return 0;
}

void serve_patrick();

void serve_bob();


int main(int argc, char **argv){
    FILE *f = fopen("flag.txt", "r");
    if (f == NULL) {
        printf("%s %s", "Please create 'flag.txt' in this directory with your",
                        "own debugging flag.\n");
        exit(0);
    }

    fgets(flag, FLAGSIZE, f);
    signal(SIGSEGV, sigsegv_handler);

    gid_t gid = getegid();
    setresgid(gid, gid, gid);

    serve_patrick();
  
    return 0;
}

void serve_patrick() {
    printf("%s %s\n%s\n%s %s\n%s",
            "Welcome to our newly-opened burger place Pico 'n Patty!",
            "Can you help the picky customers find their favorite burger?",
            "Here comes the first customer Patrick who wants a giant bite.",
            "Please choose from the following burgers:",
            "Breakf@st_Burger, Gr%114d_Cheese, Bac0n_D3luxe",
            "Enter your recommendation: ");
    fflush(stdout);

    char choice1[BUFSIZE];
    scanf("%s", choice1);
    char *menu1[3] = {"Breakf@st_Burger", "Gr%114d_Cheese", "Bac0n_D3luxe"};
    if (!on_menu(choice1, menu1, 3)) {
        printf("%s", "There is no such burger yet!\n");
        fflush(stdout);
    } else {
        int count = printf(choice1);
        if (count > 2 * BUFSIZE) {
            serve_bob();
        } else {
            printf("%s\n%s\n",
                    "Patrick is still hungry!",
                    "Try to serve him something of larger size!");
            fflush(stdout);
        }
    }
}

void serve_bob() {
    printf("\n%s %s\n%s %s\n%s %s\n%s",
            "Good job! Patrick is happy!",
            "Now can you serve the second customer?",
            "Sponge Bob wants something outrageous that would break the shop",
            "(better be served quick before the shop owner kicks you out!)",
            "Please choose from the following burgers:",
            "Pe%to_Portobello, $outhwest_Burger, Cla%sic_Che%s%steak",
            "Enter your recommendation: ");
    fflush(stdout);

    char choice2[BUFSIZE];
    scanf("%s", choice2);
    char *menu2[3] = {"Pe%to_Portobello", "$outhwest_Burger", "Cla%sic_Che%s%steak"};
    if (!on_menu(choice2, menu2, 3)) {
        printf("%s", "There is no such burger yet!\n");
        fflush(stdout);
    } else {
        printf(choice2);
        fflush(stdout);
    }
}
```

### Analysis of the code
- If the program encounters a segmentation fault (SIGSEGV), the `sigsegv_handler` prints the flag to standard output. This indicates a potential vulnerability if the program can be forced to crash
- The user inputs for burger names are stored in the buffers `choice1` and `choice2` and exceeding this size can lead to a buffer overflow
- In `serve_bob` the program directly uses `printf(choice2)` without a format string. This is a format string vulnerability and can be exploited to access or manipulate memory
- In `serve_patrick` if the `printf` call returns a value greater than 2 * BUFSIZE (64), the program transitions to `serve_bob`. Crafting a sufficiently large input for `choice1` could trigger this condition

Thus the goal is to exploit these vulnerabilities to cpature tha flag

## Solution

```bash

Welcome to our newly-opened burger place Pico 'n Patty! Can you help the picky customers find their favorite burger?
Here comes the first customer Patrick who wants a giant bite.
Please choose from the following burgers: Breakf@st_Burger, Gr%114d_Cheese, Bac0n_D3luxe
Enter your recommendation: Breakf@st_Burger
Breakf@st_BurgerPatrick is still hungry!
Try to serve him something of larger size!
