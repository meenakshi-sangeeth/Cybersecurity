# Perceiving Permissions 

## 1. Changing File Ownership

### Challenge

To collect the flag by changing the owner of the `/flag` file to the hacker user

### Thought Process

I knew that changing of the ownership of files can be done using `chown` (change owner) command followed by the username and filename 

### Solution

I used the following commands
```bash
chown hacker /flag
cat /flag
```
Upon execution, I got the flag

## 2. Groups and Files

### Challenge

To collect the flag by changing the group ownership of the flag file, and reading it by invoking `chgrp` as the hacker user

### Thought Process

I knew that group ownership can be changed with the `chgrp` (change group) command

### Solution

I used the following commands
```bash
chgrp hacker /flag
cat /flag
```
Upon execution, I got the flag

## 3. Fun With Group Names

### Challenge

To collect the flag by figuring out the name of the group that your user is in, and then invoking `chgrp`

### Thought Process

I knew that to figure out the name of the group that the user is in, I'll have to use `id` command

### Solution

I used `id` which gave me the following output
```bash
uid=1000(hacker) gid=1000(grp28569) groups=1000(grp28569)
```
Thus I figured that the names of the group is `grp28569` and I used the following commands
```bash
chgrp grp28569 /flag
cat /flag
```
Upon execution, I got the flag

## 4. Changing Permissions

### Challenge

To collect the flag by making the `/flag` file readable

### Thought Process

I knew that `chmod` allows you to tweak permissions with the mode format of `WHO+/-WHAT`, where `WHO` is user/group/other and `WHAT` is read/write/execute

### Solution

I used the following commands 
```bash
chmod o+r /flag
cat /flag
```
Upon execution, I got the flag

## 5. Executable Files

### Challenge

To collect the flag by making `/challenge/run` program executable using `chmod`

### Thought Process

I knew that programs can be made executable with the usage of `chmod` followed by `+x` and the program 

### Solution

I used the following commands
```bash
chmod +x /challenge/run
/challenge/run
```
Upon execution, I got the flag

## 6. Permission Tweaking Practice

### Challenge

To collect the flag by change the permissions of the `/challenge/pwn` file correctly eight times in a row

### Thought Process

I will have to launch `/challenge/run` to get started and then use `chmod` accordingly to the output

### Solution

I used the following commands
```bash
/challenge/run
```
Upon execution, I got the following output
```bash
Round 0 (of 8)!

Current permissions of "/challenge/pwn": rw-r--r--
* the user does have read permissions
* the user does have write permissions
- the user doesn't have execute permissions
* the group does have read permissions
- the group doesn't have write permissions
- the group doesn't have execute permissions
* the world does have read permissions
- the world doesn't have write permissions
- the world doesn't have execute permissions

Needed permissions of "/challenge/pwn": rw----r--
* the user does have read permissions
* the user does have write permissions
- the user doesn't have execute permissions

- the group doesn't have write permissions
- the group doesn't have execute permissions
* the world does have read permissions
- the world doesn't have write permissions
- the world doesn't have execute permissions
```
Similarly `chmod` was used repeatedly to change the permissions in the following manner
```bash
hacker@permissions~permission-tweaking-practice:~$ /challenge/run

You've solved all 8 rounds! I have changed the ownership
of the /flag file so that you can 'chmod' it. You won't be able to read
it until you make it readable with chmod!

- the user doesn't have write permissions
- the user doesn't have execute permissions
